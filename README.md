agent.py:

This python script creates an AI-powered agent using the Agno framework, which integrates with different LLM providers like OpenAI and Groq. It also enables tool use, such as DuckDuckGo for retrieving real-time search re

1. LLMs Have a Knowledge Cutoff
Most LLMs, including LLaMA 3, are trained on data up to a certain date.

They cannot access real-time or recent events after their training cutoff.

Example: If LLaMA 3 was last trained in 2024, it won‚Äôt know who won the CT 2025 finals unless it‚Äôs updated.

2. DuckDuckGo Provides Real-Time Information
DuckDuckGo Tools allow the agent to search the web for real-time data.

This is especially useful for:

Live sports results (e.g., "Who won the India vs New Zealand finals in CT 2025?")

Stock prices & market trends (e.g., "What is Tesla‚Äôs stock price today?")

Breaking news (e.g., "What happened in the latest Apple event?")

Weather updates (e.g., "What‚Äôs the weather in New York right now?")

3. Combining LLM + Search Makes the Agent More Powerful
LLM: Provides context, reasoning, and conversation flow.

DuckDuckGo Search: Fetches fresh data when needed.

Together, they allow the AI to answer questions based on both past knowledge and live updates.

So basically even though we are using an LLM, DuckDuckGo helps bridge the gap between pre-trained knowledge and real-time information. This makes the AI more versatile, accurate, and up-to-date! 


multi_agents.py:

This python script creates a multi-agent AI system that can fetch real-time web data and financial insights using different models and tools.

- Multi-Agent Collaboration: Each agent specializes in a specific task.
- Combines LLM + Real-Time Search: Overcomes LLM‚Äôs knowledge cutoff.
- Financial Analysis + Market News: Helps in investment decisions.
- Structured Responses: Uses tables and sources for clarity.



agent_memory.py:

This code defines an AI agent specialized in Thai cuisine by combining web search capabilities, a PDF-based knowledge base, and a vector database for efficient retrieval. 

Key Concept Differences
Knowledge Base (knowledge)

Works like a library or Wikipedia: stores and retrieves structured information.

Example: Searching for "chicken soup recipe" finds exact text matches.

Vector Database (vector_db)

Works like Google Photos face search: finds similar content even if words are different.

Example: Searching for "warm broth dish with poultry" might find chicken soup because of similarity.

When to Use What?
Scenario	Use Knowledge Base	Use Vector Database
Exact information retrieval	‚úÖ	‚ùå
Finding similar concepts	‚ùå	‚úÖ
Semantic search (meaning-based)	‚ùå	‚úÖ
Structured text storage	‚úÖ	‚ùå
Large-scale search efficiency	‚ùå	‚úÖ
üöÄ Final Summary
A knowledge base is a structured system that stores and retrieves raw text or documents.

A vector database converts text into numerical vectors, enabling AI to find similar content based on meaning rather than exact words.

Both can work together: A knowledge base organizes information, while a vector database enhances retrieval with AI-powered semantic search. üöÄ

A knowledge base alone can be used for searching, but it primarily works with exact matches (like traditional keyword searches). When we combine it with a vector database, we get both exact match + semantic match capabilities.

How They Work Together:
Keyword Search (Exact Match - Knowledge Base)

If a query directly matches text in the knowledge base, it returns that information.

Example: Searching "chicken soup recipe" finds exact recipe text in the stored PDFs.

Semantic Search (Vector Database)

If no exact match is found, the system converts the query into vector embeddings and searches for similar meanings.

Example: Searching "warm broth dish with poultry" returns "chicken soup recipe", even though the words don't match exactly.

Hybrid Search (Combining Both)

Many systems first check for an exact match, then use vector search if needed.

This ensures faster results while improving accuracy with semantic understanding.

Final Thought:
By integrating a vector database with a knowledge base, we make the system smarter, allowing it to understand meaning, context, and synonyms, rather than just relying on exact words. üöÄ
Here the LLM is required for interpreting, summarizing, reasoning, and generating responses in natural language.
